# Detroit: Become Human Randomizer
A randomizer for the Quantic Dream masterpiece "Detroit: Become Human" (Steam version - don't use this on the Epic Games version! I'll be buying that version eventually and provide another asset list for it.)

Expect lots of softlocks and occasional game crashes. This is only designed to help get funny clips.

There's configuration variables at the start of the script. You can set your language and enable/disable certain features.

Modifications are welcome. My only request is that you keep them free and open source (and unless your version is a full rewrite, please don't take full credit for the script)

Instructions:
- Make sure you have both the script and the asset list in the same folder! The script isn't going to work without the asset list.
- Be sure to back up your BigFile_PC.idx file before running the script
- Once you run the script, navigate to the folder Detroit: Become Human is installed to (the one with the BigFile_PC packages) and click "Select Folder"
- Wait 1-5 seconds and run the game to see randomized stuff

(End of instructions)

Oh, and one more important thing to note:
Model offsets were obtained using Deadray ([d](https://www.deadray.com/detroit/)https://www.deadray.com/detroit/)

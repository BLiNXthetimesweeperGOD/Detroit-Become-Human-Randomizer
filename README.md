# Detroit-Become-Human-Randomizer
A randomizer for the Quantic Dream masterpiece "Detroit: Become Human" (Steam version - not tested on the Epic Games version)

Expect lots of softlocks and occasional game crashes. This is only designed to help get funny clips.

There's configuration variables at the start of the script. You can set your language and enable/disable certain features.

Modifications are welcome. My only request is that you keep them free and open source (and unless your version is a full rewrite, please don't take full credit for the script)
